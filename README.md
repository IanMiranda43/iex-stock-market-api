# IEXstockMarketAPI

Developed using Node.js based system, IEXstockMarketAPI its an simple system to get stock market data from the [IEX Cloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) and present it to user.

At now we have just an simple system of requests for companies and yours quotes data. The company description is saved in database at first request, and then, the newer requests for the same company will be get from your own DB 'cache' system. This cannot be done with the quotes data requests, they are changing every second and need to be always updated.

### The system use: 
* `axios` lib to make HTTP requests
* `express-handlebars` to server side rendering
* `Sequelize ORM` to manage the SQL database
* `Socket.io` to real time updates

_at now are configured to use MySQL database_
